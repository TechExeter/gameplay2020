					<h3>Joypad Arcade</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Our friends at <a href="http://www.joypadbar.co.uk/joypad-arcade" target="_blank">Joypad</a> are providing a selection of retro consoles to give over a dozen stations of gaming goodness. SNES, MegaDrive, GameCube, Dreamcast, N64, PlayStation - we've got them all!</p>
				<p>We know everyone has their favourite consoles and games - prefer to break out the special moves in Street Fighter II over Streets of Rage? Rather hit the track with Mario Kart or Micro Machines? Sooner settle old scores with Goldeneye or Super Smash Bros.? Whatever your tastes, we should have you covered!</p>
