					<h3>We think Exeter needs to <em>play</em> more!</h3>
				</header>
			<p>We've got some amazing play/gaming centres in Exeter - escape rooms, board game caf√©s, tabletop boardgaming shops, and a games development course at Exeter College - so we thought it would be a good idea to bring together everyone for a festival of playability!</p>

					<h3>GAME>PLAY 2019</h3>
				</header>
				<p>We only had a short time and tiny budget to put together this event, but we've managed to put together a day full of activities - two theatre shows, workshops, plus retro and indie games showcases. But we want to do more - more art, more interactive workshops, more theatre shows and more games! So if you enjoy what we've done this year, we'd love to hear your thoughts on how to make the event better for next year.</p>
