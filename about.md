					<h3>We think Exeter needs to <em>play</em> more!</h3>
				</header>
			<p>We've got some amazing play/gaming centres in Exeter - escape rooms, board game caf√©s, tabletop boardgaming shops, and a games development course at Exeter College - so we thought it would be a good idea to bring together everyone for a festival of playability!</p>

					<h3>GAME>PLAY 2020</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Last year's one-day festival was so much fun we had to bring it back - so we've partnered with Exeter City Council to run it alongside Exeter Festival! We've got plenty on, but are always up for more - more art, more interactive workshops and more games! So if you enjoy what we've done this year, we'd love to hear your thoughts on how to make the event better for next year.</p>
