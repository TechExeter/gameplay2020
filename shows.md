<p>The following shows are ticketed. Tickets can be purchased from the box office on the day, or reserve your seat in advance via the website (highly recommended - we've worked hard to keep these ticket prices low at just a few pounds each, so they're sure to go quickly!). Please note: children under the age of 12 must be accompanied by an adult.</p>
