<h2 id="content">Photosensitivity/Epilepsy Seizures</h2>
<div class="boxed"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Exhibits at this event may feature flashing lights, dimly lit areas, and unusual lighting patterns</div>
	<p>A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games. Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these ‚Äúphotosensitive epileptic seizures‚Äù while watching video games.</p>

	<p>These seizures may have a variety of symptoms, including lightheadedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion, or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects.</p>

	<p><strong>Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms.</strong> Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms. Children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures. 
	</p>

<h2>VR Headsets</h2>
<p>Some people may experience motion sickness, nausea, disorientation, blurred vision or other discomfort while viewing virtual reality content. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop using immediately and remove the VR headset.</p>

					<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
				</header>
	<p>GAME&gt;PLAY is an event being run by TechExeter.</p>
<p>TechExeter is a Community Interest Company and it values your right to privacy. We always have, and we always will.</p>

<h2>Types of data we collect</h2>
<h3>Website Cookies</h3>
<p>We only use cookies to make our sites function correctly - we don't use them for data mining or advertising.</p>
<h3>Goolge Analytics</h3>
<p>When someone visits a TechExeter site, we use a third party service (Google Analytics) to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make, and do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website.</p>
<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
<p>If you register for our newsletter, we will use that information to tell you about stuff you‚Äôve asked us to tell you about; to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to check our records are right and to check every now and then that you‚Äôre happy and satisfied. We don&#8217;t rent or trade email lists with other organisations and businesses.</p>
<p><em>We use a third-party provider, MailChimp, to deliver our newsletter. We gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies to help us monitor and improve our e-newsletter. For more information, please see <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/">MailChimp‚Äôs privacy notice</a>. You can unsubscribe to general mailings at any time of the day or night by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our emails</em></p>
<h3>Ticketing Data</h3>
<p>If you register for a ticket to our events through meetup.com, Exeter Phoenix or Eventbrite then we will store your details so that we can administer that event. This data is not used for marketing purposes, and only used for contacting you with news in relationship to that event.</p>
<p>Payment details are held securely by these organisations and are never shared directly with us.</p>

<h3>Photographs and Video Footage</h3>
<p>We normally take still photographs and video at events that we are involved with, and we use them for promoting TechExeter&#8217;s activities. This media could be used inside video montages, posters, presentations and shared on social media, but in all cases they would remain under the control of TechExeter CIC and not passed onto third parties.</p>
<p><em>If you don&#8217;t want your picture to be taken at an event then just come talk to us, either before or at the event.</em></p>
