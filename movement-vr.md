					<h3>Triangular Pixels' VR Expo</h3>
				</header>
				<div class="boxed">Location: Workshop</div>
				<p>Triangular Pixels are award winning Cornish indie games developers, with a passion for fun, light hearted, and manic local multiplayer gaming. They're bringing their latest games for you to have an exclusive play on!</p>
				
				<h3 style="margin:0px;">Unseen Diplomacy, HTC Vive</h3>
				<p>Unseen Diplomacy casts you as an elite member of The British Espionage Tactical Initiative, defeating the plans of evil-doers around the world. It's a real-life obstacle course using every inch of the room-scale space - you will run and roll & sneak your way through volanco lairs and moon bases. </p>

				<h3 style="margin:0px;">Smash Hit Plunder,  Playstation VR</h3>
				<p>It’s time to wreck a castle! Smash alone, together or against friends in VR and TV! Smash Hit Plunder is a physics-based tear-it-up set in a medieval castle. Be a powerful mage with the freedom to roam in first-person, inside a retro isometric game. Fight ghosts, munch food, start fires and cause chaos and collect as much treasure as possible before your time ends!</p>
