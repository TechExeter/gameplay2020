				<div class="boxed">Location: 1st Floor / Meeting Room</div>

				<p>A game installation designed by Alistair Aitcheson to mix physical movement with teamwork, communication and problem-solving.</p>

				<p>One physical space, four big buttons and codes to be cracked! Players must use clues scattered around the room to uncover a sequence of button presses, and run around to bash the buttons in the right order.</p>

				<p>You may have to flip through maps, pick apart circuit diagrams or rifle through a book of spy photos, but one thingâ€™s for certain: the best codebreakers work as a team!</p>
